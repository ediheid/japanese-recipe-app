# A simple React App using a recipe API to create a Japanese Recipe search site

Removed filter functions for now although they do work - need to fix styling before I uncomment them - made a kind of fake input to add the dropdown section for filter options

- Vegan search
- Vegetarian search

### Notes for myself WIP:

- Bring in 'no matches found' content message when no results are returned
- Update Filter styling to bring back
